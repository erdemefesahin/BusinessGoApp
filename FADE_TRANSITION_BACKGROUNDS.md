### 🔄 **Smooth Fade Transitions**
- **Duration**: 2-second fade between backgrounds
- **Hold Time**: 3 seconds per background view
- **Loop**: Continuous cycling through all 3 backgrounds
- **Timing**: Starts 2 seconds after initial animations

### 🎨 **Visual Design**
- **Opacity**: Semi-transparent icons (20% opacity)
- **Size**: Large 40px business emojis
- **Positioning**: Strategic placement to avoid content overlap
- **Color**: White with alpha for subtle background effect

## Technical Implementation

### Animation Structure:
```typescript
// Background fade animation values
const backgroundFade1 = useRef(new Animated.Value(1)).current;
const backgroundFade2 = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;
const backgroundFade3 = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;
```

### Transition Sequence:
1. **Phase 1**: Show Background 1 → Fade to Background 2
2. **Phase 2**: Show Background 2 → Fade to Background 3  
3. **Phase 3**: Show Background 3 → Fade back to Background 1
4. **Loop**: Infinite repetition

### Positioning System:
- Strategic placement using percentage-based positioning
- Avoids overlapping with main content (logo, text, buttons)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

- **Analytics**: Data-driven decisions (📊📈)
